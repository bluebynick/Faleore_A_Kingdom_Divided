Faleore; a Kingdom Divided is a real-time strategy game focused on the 
war of Faleore. In the game the player will be asked to choose between
two factions, the people of Axela and those of Dannicka, then asked 
to choose which cities (castles and villages) are under your command as
new ruler of the people. The cities you choose will have an outcome on
how you fare in the game and they each have their own individual benefits. 

Gameplay:
The game itself is fairly simple. Each city has it's own specific type
of benefit that can be viewed after selection by clicking upon the 
city. The benefits are: 
-Cultural benefits that improve citizens' happiness
-Military boost that improve the max amount of solider's that can be trained
-Gold Production boost that improves the rate at which your gold increases
A healthy balance of the three is very important and the king/queen will
be presented with specific choices pertaining to each individual city's
needs and benefits. 

The end goal is to control every city in the land and thus when you feel
that you have enough troops you can attack other cities through the 
combat mechanic. You cannot attack a city that has more defending troops
than you are attacking with and there are certain benefits to attacking
with more troops. If you have 100 more than your opponent, your dice
roll can be greater than, equal to or one less and still win. Greater 
number by less than 100 means your roll can be greater than or equal to.
Same number of troops means your roll must be greater than your enemy. 

One of the princple aspects of the game is the decision princple.
Every 10 seconds the game will present the king/queen with a different 
decision pertaining to something happening in the realm and the user
chooses whether or not to pay a fee and resolve the issue. If the user
chooses to pass on helping too many times, it is likely the citizens 
will grow angry and rebel. 

The king/queen can train a small amount of troops for a fee.
